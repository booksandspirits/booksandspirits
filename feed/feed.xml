&lt;p&gt;Stuart and Mark also had the opportunity over the weekend to participate as judges in the Eddie Aikau Foundation&#39;s essay contest.

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Aloha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Books &amp;amp; Spirits is delighted to get back in action! In partnership with the University of Hawaii at MƒÅnoa Better Tomorrow Speaker Series, we&#39;re delighted to host Marcus Eriksen, author of Junk Raft, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://marcuseriksenseries.eventbrite.com&quot;&gt;very special event&lt;/a&gt; at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel on August 29th. You can register here:¬†&lt;a href=&quot;https://marcuseriksenseries.eventbrite.com&quot;&gt;https://marcuseriksenseries.eventbrite.com.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marcus Eriksen is an environmental scientist, educator and author committed to building stronger communities through art, science, adventure and activism. ¬†His books chronicle rafting adventures down rivers and across oceans, and highlight his experience as a veteran of war and as a scientist for conservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, he and his co-navigator, Joel Paschal, constructed a ‚Äújunk raft‚Äù made of plastic trash and set themselves adrift from Los Angeles to Hawaii, with no motor or support vessel, confronting perilous cyclones, food shortages, and a fast decaying raft. Floating on 15,000 plastic bottles and a Cessna airplane fuselage as a cabin, they journeyed 2,600 miles in 88 days, bringing attention to challenges of plastics pollution and the work of the 5 Gyres Institute, the organization he co-founded with his wife Anna Cummins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To celebrate the 10th anniversary of his journey, there will be a special screening of the new film Junk Raft, followed by a Q&amp;amp;A with Dr. Eriksen. The event is FREE! There will be a cash bar and light pupus. Copies of Junk Raft will be available for purchase at the event. As the event is free and space is limited, we encourage you to reserve your spot on Eventbrite as soon as possible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marcuseriksenseries.eventbrite.com/&quot;&gt;https://marcuseriksenseries.eventbrite.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, our own Stuart Coleman interviewed Dr. Eriksen for Civil Beat. You can read that interview here:¬†&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stuartholmescoleman.com/blog/a-most-interesting-man&quot;&gt;https://www.stuartholmescoleman.com/blog/a-most-interesting-man.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This awesome event wouldn&#39;t be possible with our sponsors: The Better Tomorrow Speaker Series, the Kokua Hawaii Foundation, the Surfrider Foundation, GEICO, the Royal Hawaiian Hotel, the UHM Alumni Foundation, the Public Policy Center, Conservation International, 5 Gyres, Hawaii Conservation Alliance, Leap Lap, and the University of Hawaii at Manoa.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Aloha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry for our long absence! Stuart and Mark have both had crazy travel schedules....But fear not! Books &amp;amp; Spirits will return, we are plotting an event in August! Details below....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.booksandspirits.com/fun-at-the-hawaii-books-and-music-festival-and-our-next-event/ou0kAkTGAr-2000.avif 2000w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.booksandspirits.com/fun-at-the-hawaii-books-and-music-festival-and-our-next-event/ou0kAkTGAr-2000.webp 2000w&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://www.booksandspirits.com/fun-at-the-hawaii-books-and-music-festival-and-our-next-event/ou0kAkTGAr-2000.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2000&quot; height=&quot;890&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, we had a great time at &lt;strong&gt;The Hawaii Books &amp;amp; Music Festival&lt;/strong&gt;!¬† It has been wonderful collaborating with Roger Jellinek and the HBMF, and we were stoked to see Books &amp;amp; Spirits authors Adam Johnson and Bill Finnegan at the Festival! Stuart introduced Adam, who gave a riveting talk about his novel The Orphan Master‚Äôs Son, life in North Korea and the thin line between reality and fiction there.¬† Bill talked about his memoir Barbarian Days and the fickle nature of memory. Both authors enthralled their audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.booksandspirits.com/fun-at-the-hawaii-books-and-music-festival-and-our-next-event/f5UniTz_BH-3273.avif 3273w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.booksandspirits.com/fun-at-the-hawaii-books-and-music-festival-and-our-next-event/f5UniTz_BH-3273.webp 3273w&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://www.booksandspirits.com/fun-at-the-hawaii-books-and-music-festival-and-our-next-event/f5UniTz_BH-3273.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;3273&quot; height=&quot;1489&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark&#39;s social reading app &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bookshipapp.com&quot;&gt;Bookship&lt;/a&gt; had a booth at the festival.¬†Bookship¬†lets you share your reading experiences with your friends and family - it&#39;s like a virtual book club on your phone. We demonstrated the app for folks and the inimitable Justine Espiritu set up a pop-up reading library in the booth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And...we&#39;re delighted to host Dr. Marcus Eriksen, author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Junk-Raft-Activism-Plastic-Pollution-ebook/dp/B01I85NQ90/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1526578221&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=junk+raft&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=codexmap-20&amp;amp;linkId=237da82a9b57d36251c1e89e5035ed09&quot;&gt;Junk Raft&lt;/a&gt;, on August 28th, at our next Books &amp;amp; Spirits!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marcus is an¬†environmental scientist, educator and author committed to building stronger communities through art, science, adventure and activism. In 2008 Marcus and Joel Paschal¬†sailed from Los Angeles to Hawaii on the¬†Junk, ‚Äúa raft made from plastic bottles, with thirty old sailboat masts for a deck and a Cessna 310 airplane as a cabin.‚Äù &lt;em&gt;Junk Raft&lt;/em&gt; tells the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re excited for the event and will provide more details as we get closer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(We&#39;re excited to let you know Jaimal Yogis, our first Books &amp;amp; Spirits author, has a new book out: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jaimalyogis.com/allourwaves/&quot;&gt;All Our Waves Are Water&lt;/a&gt;, and even more excited to say he&#39;s &lt;strong&gt;back in the islands in September&lt;/strong&gt; - you can see ¬†him at¬†a book signing at Barnes &amp;amp; Noble Ala Moana at 2 pm on Saturday September 16th and a talk and book signing at Lumeria Maui at 5 pm on September 17th.¬†In celebration, we wanted to share with you a recent post by Jaimal, reposted with permission from &lt;a href=&quot;https://spiritualityhealth.com/articles/2017/07/03/six-lessons-from-the-sea&quot;&gt;Spirituality &amp;amp; Health Magazine&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple of decades of surfing and traveling, and writing about surfing and traveling, these are six lessons that I use every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.booksandspirits.com/six-lessons-from-the-sea-by-jaimal-yogis/SgeXZ-TGAv-300.avif 300w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.booksandspirits.com/six-lessons-from-the-sea-by-jaimal-yogis/SgeXZ-TGAv-300.webp 300w&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://www.booksandspirits.com/six-lessons-from-the-sea-by-jaimal-yogis/SgeXZ-TGAv-300.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;199&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-the-struggle-is-the-joy&quot;&gt;1. The struggle is the joy.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Videos and films make surfers look like we‚Äôre always cruising around, carefree, on crystalline waves, no work involved. But¬†&lt;em&gt;extremely little of each surf session is spent actually standing up on your surfboard on a wave&lt;/em&gt;‚Äîmaybe 1 percent. Most of the time you‚Äôre paddling until your shoulders feel like they‚Äôre being cattle-branded. If you‚Äôre looking to have a good time, it‚Äôs essential to find a way to enjoy paddling, or at least good-naturedly bear it. So surfing is life. The¬†good stuff‚Äîchocolate and great sex and weddings and hilarious jokes‚Äîfills a minute portion of an adult lifespan.¬†The rest of life is paddling: work, paying bills, flossing, getting sick, dying. But nobody ever found lasting joy from being fed beauty and riches and ease from a silver spoon. The sea has taught me that if I‚Äôm clear on where I‚Äôm going and why it‚Äôs good,¬†&lt;em&gt;the struggle is the joy&lt;/em&gt;. Plus, the burn helps you enjoy the good waves even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-celebrate-let-go&quot;&gt;2. Celebrate. Let go.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because those exceptional waves come along only once in a blue moon, I think it‚Äôs important to celebrate them. Hoot, high-five, shake your butt. Too-cool-for-school stoicism isn‚Äôt any fun. Recent neuroscience shows that the more positive emotion we bring to an experience, the more neurons fire and wire together, leaving our brains more optimistic and open. The flip side, however, is that if the waves are perfect today, you can bet a storm is coming. Clinging to good conditions is like trying to hold the sea still. It leads to frustration. So dance, sing, toast. Then let go of its ever happening again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-never-give-up-do-question-your-approach&quot;&gt;3. Never give up. Do question your approach.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My home break in San Francisco is notoriously difficult for paddling out. Complex wave fields, plus ferocious tidal currents, can, on big days, mean even the strongest surfers end up paddling for an hour and never making it out. But when you‚Äôve been sprinting for 45 minutes‚Äîgetting mashed into the sand by cold, angry wave after wave‚Äîif you just believe you will make it, if you keep going forward no matter how much it hurts,¬†&lt;em&gt;you will get out there&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except when you don‚Äôt. When sheer grit and faith don‚Äôt work, get out of the water, catch your breath, question why that approach didn‚Äôt work, then look for a more favorable current that can help ferry you out‚Äîpreferably one that‚Äôs working for another surfer. If that approach fails too, go home and have a cup of tea. You haven‚Äôt given up. All your paddling has put you in better shape for making it out tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-feed-courage&quot;&gt;4. Feed courage.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get better at surfing and have the most fun, we need to challenge ourselves with more difficult waves. Courage is key. But courage is not the same as bravado. Courage stems from the French word c≈ìur, heart. It‚Äôs tied to humanity‚Äôs need for novelty‚Äîto grow, learn, and love. Bravado is all about proving something because of hidden insecurity. Courage is patient. Courage trains, observes, selects the right board to match the type of waves, then paddles out in waves that are just at the edge of its ability. Bravado is repressed fear, so it‚Äôs impatient. It‚Äôs rushed. Bravado paddles out into surf it probably can‚Äôt handle just because the cameras are on. Bravado might bring some moments of fame, but it will eventually backfire: injury, loss of brain cells, early death. Courage is the long game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-be-still-be-clear&quot;&gt;5. Be still. Be clear.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are mostly water. Even our brains are about 80 percent water. The stillest water is the clearest, and there is a corollary for our aqueous brains. To find out what‚Äôs going on deep down‚Äîwhat we want, who we are, what we‚Äôre made of‚Äîwe need stillness and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sea calms itself by stopping the harsh winds, and we can calm ourselves with breath: meditation, yoga, prayer, stargazing, just sitting quietly on your board between waves. Whatever form it takes, stillness brings more steady breath. Steady breath brings clarity of mind. These moments of clarity don‚Äôt last. Life can be violent, murky, and stormy. But if we‚Äôve stilled ourselves‚Äîand know the reef or rock formation that‚Äôs underneath that murk‚Äîwhen the monstrous rollers come off the horizon, we can ride them with confidence, or feel okay letting them pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-accept-yourself-accept-others&quot;&gt;6. Accept yourself. Accept others.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waves arise when air molecules, seeking pockets of low density, blow over water. Like goose bumps, wind forms ripples on the water‚Äôs skin, and those ripples act as sails, trapping more air. When wind is sustained, that energy congeals into hefty mounds of water. Swells. Energy in motion will stay in motion. So the swells travel, often for thousands of miles, sorting themselves as they move into tribes of similar speed and size,¬†&lt;em&gt;sets&lt;/em&gt;. From above, these sets appear like a parade of blue objects: hard, defined. But this is an illusion. Little water is moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of a wave is a ‚Äúdisturbance moving through a medium,‚Äù and the memory of wind is spiraling through the medium of ocean. Atoms, molecules, cells are bouncing air‚Äôs message in an endless domino effect‚Äîa game of telephone. Each swell is a sort of illusion that only looks like firm matter in motion. And people are the same way. We look firm: head, shoulders, knees, and toes. But the bits of matter that compose our bodies are constantly getting traded out by new water, new food, new air, new chemicals. There is no static amount of stuff that stays with us from birth to death, no lump of clay you could point to and say,¬†&lt;em&gt;See? Here I was as a baby, and now I‚Äôm stretched to my current size‚Äîroughly the same lump I began as&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as the wave only exists as the memory of wind moving between particles, we are the memory of some primordial, beginningless exhalation‚Äîthe cause that caused the cause of the Big Bang and every Big Bang before it. And we only exist as separate entities insofar as this breath has evolved us to perceive ourselves that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

    <title>A review of Barbarian Days from the Maui Time</title>
    <link href="https://www.booksandspirits.com/a-review-of-barbarian-days-from-the-maui-time/" />
    <updated>2016-12-04T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.booksandspirits.com/a-review-of-barbarian-days-from-the-maui-time/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Aloha everyone! We had a great time with Bill Finnegan at Books &amp;amp; Spirits last week. A synopsis coming soon, but in the meantime we spotted this great review by Andrew O&#39;Riordan¬†from Maui Time. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúPictures tell our story better than words ever can,‚Äù Pipeline Master Gerry Lopez once said about surfing. Yes and no. Yes, the camera best captures the rainbow spectrum of translucent green-blues, the wafting sea mist, the taut muscles, the thousand-yard stares and the cavernous barrels. But it‚Äôs the more ancient¬†medium of words that allows us to penetrate deeper into the myths of surfing, deeper into the proverbial tube of life, deeper into that sacred philosophical space we all seek....&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mauitime.com/entertainment/community/barbarian-days-author-william-finnegan-is-coming-to-maui-heres-why-his-surf-memoir-is-a-masterpiece/&quot;&gt;http://mauitime.com/entertainment/community/barbarian-days-author-william-finnegan-is-coming-to-maui-heres-why-his-surf-memoir-is-a-masterpiece/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
