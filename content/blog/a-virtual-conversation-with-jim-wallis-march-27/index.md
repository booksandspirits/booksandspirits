In collaboration with **Rev. David Turner** and **Church of the Crossroads** in Honolulu, we at Books & Spirits are excited to host "A Virtual Conversation" (via Zoom) with Rev. Jim Wallis, a leading voice of Progressive Christianity. We will talk with Rev. Wallis about his books [America's Original Sin](https://americasoriginalsin.com) and [Christ in Crisis](https://book.sojo.net) and how we have been torn apart by bitter partisan politics, institutional racism and Christian Nationalism. There will be an opportunity for questions & answers.
