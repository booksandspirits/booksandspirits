**TL/DR: You need to be at the next Books & Spirits on September 11th!**

After a bit of an hiatus, we could not be more delighted to get Books & Spirits back in action. In partnership with [The Hawaii Book & Music Festival](http://hawaiibookandmusicfestival.com/), we are stoked to have ANOTHER Pulitzer Prize winner, **Adam Johnson**, as our guest. His book _The Orphan Master's Son_ is the once-again highly topical, Pulitzer Prize–winning, _New York Times_ bestselling novel of North Korea: an epic journey into the heart of the world’s most mysterious dictatorship.

**“Imagine Charles Dickens paying a visit to Pyongyang, and you see the canvas on which \[Adam\] Johnson is painting here.”_—The Washington Post_**

More recently his book _Fortune Smiles_ won the National Book Award. He's also won any number of other awards we won't bother listing. Please join us for an intimate conversation with this talented artist.

We are happy once again to be hosted by Revolusun in Kakaako.

We are super excited to have pupus from [Encore Saloon](http://www.encoresaloon.com/), an Ocean Friendly restaurant that makes some of the best Mexican food in town! Our mixologist is Dave Power, the "barman in residence" (how cool a title is that?) with Southern Glazer's Wine & Spirits of Hawaii.
