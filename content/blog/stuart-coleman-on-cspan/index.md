Stuart and Mark also had the opportunity over the weekend to participate as judges in the Eddie Aikau Foundation's essay contest. It was such an honor to participate and an inspiration to read the hundreds and hundreds of essays submitted by 7th-10th graders.

We are hoping to pull off our next Books & Spirits before the end of the year - stay tuned!
