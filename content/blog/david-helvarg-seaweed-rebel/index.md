Thanks to everyone for coming out to see David Helvarg! David's passion for the sea washed over everyone who was there. It was very interesting to hear about the recent expansion of [Papahānaumokuākea](http://www.papahanaumokuakea.gov/) - a ocean-based national monument 10 years in the making. We also had fun hearing about David's adventures as a war reporter & private investigator. Our favorite: the time his car helped solve a case. Who knew car talk could offer for a crime?

Christian Self & the crew at [Bevy](http://bevyhawaii.com/) knocked it out of the park. His Seaweed Rebel (a seaweed-infused, grapefruit laced cocktail) had people raving, for both the taste and the uniqueness. It's no surprise he's an international award-winning mixologist. And the pupus were onolicious. Visit [Bevy](http://bevyhawaii.com/), you won't be sorry. As always, Mahalo to Revolusun Smart Home for lending us their wonderful space!

OK so we've done two of these Books & Spirits now. We're digging it. Are you? Would you take just a moment to take our survey? We'd love to improve! [Click for Survey](https://mark579.typeform.com/to/Ph5WGt).

We're also excited for our next event on November 30th, featuring **Kaui Hart Hemmings**, author of the recently released _How to Party With an Infant_, and _The Descendants_, on which the Oscar-winning film starring George Clooney was based.
