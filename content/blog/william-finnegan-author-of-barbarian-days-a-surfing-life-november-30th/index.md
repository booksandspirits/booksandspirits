Hi Folks,

Due to unforeseen circumstances, Kaui Hart Hemmings will not be able to join us on November. We look forward to rescheduling her for a Books & Spirits in the new year. Those of you who purchased tickets already will receive a refund. In the meantime, we suggest reading _How to Party with an Infant_. It's an uproariously funny "Bonfire of the Vanities" for the mommy and daddy set.

But have no fear, we are on the job. We are delighted to welcome William Finnegan to the November 30th Books & Spirits. William is the author of Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life, which won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Autobiography!

William Finnegan is the author of _Cold New World_, _A Complicated War_, _Dateline Soweto_, _Crossing the Line_, and _Barbarian Days_. He has twice been a National Magazine Award finalist and has won numerous journalism awards, including two Overseas Press Club awards since 2009. _Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life_ received the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Autobiography. A staff writer at The New Yorker since 1987, he lives in Manhattan.

He lives and works in Manhattan but is no stranger to the islands, having first lived here as a teenager and returning regularly. We're excited his schedule lined up for this!
