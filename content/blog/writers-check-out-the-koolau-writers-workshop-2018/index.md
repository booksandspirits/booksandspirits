The 2018 Ko'olau Writer's Workshop is on! Organized by author and "friend of Books & Spirits" Tyler McMahon, it's a great opportunity to study the craft of writing in an awesome setting and with great authors.

****KWW 2018 will feature Shawna Yang Ryan!****

Shawna Yang Ryan is a former Fulbright scholar and the author of _Water Ghosts_ (2009) and _Green Island_ (2016). She is the Director of the Creative Writing Program at the University of Hawai\`i at Manoa. Her short fiction has appeared in _ZYZZYVA, The Asian American Literary Review, Kartika Review,_ and _The Berkeley Fiction Review_.

The Ko\`olau Writers Workshop offers instruction and advice to writers of all levels. Held each spring, KWW features intensive workshop sessions in poetry, fiction, creative nonfiction, and scriptwriting. A distinguished guest writer will give a keynote address and Q&A on the craft and practice of writing. Registration fee includes your choice of two workshop sessions (one in the morning and the other in the afternoon), as well as coffee and light breakfast, lunch, and the keynote address.
